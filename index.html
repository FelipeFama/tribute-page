        Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury
        King.
        After his parents separated when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised by his
        mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time,
        and
        in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for
        good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was
        persuaded
        by her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other family members provided a small
        house
        in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
        kitchens
        of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.
      </p>

        Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his
        sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
        MAINE
        CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support
        the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in
        Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in
        English
        and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation found
        him
        4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

        He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the
        University of Maine at Orono, where they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a
        teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her student
        loan
        and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor") to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967.
        Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were
        later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other anthologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy, the public high
        school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and
        to work on novels.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for publication. On Mother's Day of that
        year,
        Stephen learned from his new editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would provide him
        with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
